## 🏗️ **Architecture Improvements**

### **Service Management**
```typescript
// Before: Manual service initialization
await cache_service.initialize()
await performance_service.start_monitoring()
// ... 20+ more services

// After: Centralized management
await enterprise_service_manager.initialize_all_services()
```

### **Component Organization**
```typescript
// Before: Scattered imports
import Button from './Button'
import Card from './Card'
// ... many individual imports

// After: Unified exports
import { Button, Card, MetricCard, StatusIndicator } from '../ui'
```

### **Health Monitoring**
```typescript
// Before: No centralized health checks
// After: Comprehensive monitoring
const health = await enterprise_service_manager.health_check_all_services()
```
